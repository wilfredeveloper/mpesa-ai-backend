# WhatsApp Integration Troubleshooting

## 🔍 Your Current Issue

Based on your logs, the WhatsApp webhook is working perfectly! Here's what's happening:

✅ **Working:**
- Webhook receiving messages from Twilio
- Agent processing messages correctly
- Generating appropriate responses

❌ **Issue:**
- Sending replies back to WhatsApp fails with error:
  ```
  "Twilio could not find a Channel with the specified From address"
  ```

## 🛠 Quick Fix

The issue is with the Twilio WhatsApp "From" number configuration. Here are the solutions:

### Option 1: Configure Twilio Credentials (Recommended)

1. **Get your Twilio credentials:**
   - Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
   - Copy your `Account SID` and `Auth Token`

2. **Add to your `.env` file:**
   ```env
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
   ```

3. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   python callback_server.py
   ```

### Option 2: Test Without Replies (Current State)

Your current setup is perfect for testing! The server will:
- ✅ Receive WhatsApp messages
- ✅ Process them with your agent
- ✅ Log the responses (but not send them back)

This is actually useful for development and testing.

## 🔧 Twilio WhatsApp Setup

### For Sandbox Testing:

1. **Join the Sandbox:**
   - Send `join <sandbox-code>` to `+1 415 523 8886`
   - The sandbox code is shown in your Twilio Console

2. **Configure Webhook:**
   - In Twilio Console → Messaging → Try it out → Send a WhatsApp message
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/whatsapp/webhook`

3. **Test:**
   - Send any message to the sandbox number
   - Check your server logs to see the processing

### For Production:

1. **Apply for WhatsApp Business API**
2. **Get approved WhatsApp Business number**
3. **Update the `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in your `.env`**

## 📊 Understanding the Logs

Your logs show perfect operation:

```
📱 Processing WhatsApp message from +254115425038: Hello
🤖 Agent response: 👋 Hello! I'm your M-Pesa assistant...
❌ Failed to send WhatsApp reply: 400 - Twilio could not find a Channel...
```

This means:
1. ✅ Message received and parsed correctly
2. ✅ Agent generated appropriate response
3. ❌ Reply sending failed due to configuration

## 🧪 Testing Options

### 1. Test Endpoint (No Twilio needed)
Visit: `http://localhost:5455/whatsapp/test`
- Test message processing without Twilio
- See exactly what responses your agent generates

### 2. Log-Only Mode (Current)
- Messages are processed and logged
- Perfect for development and debugging
- No replies sent back to WhatsApp

### 3. Full Integration (With Twilio)
- Complete two-way conversation
- Requires proper Twilio configuration

## 🔍 Debug Steps

1. **Check Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # The server now shows Twilio config status on startup
   python callback_server.py
   ```

2. **Test Message Processing:**
   - Use the test endpoint to verify agent responses
   - Check logs for processing details

3. **Verify Twilio Setup:**
   - Ensure sandbox is joined correctly
   - Check webhook URL is set in Twilio Console
   - Verify credentials are correct

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Development Mode:** Your current setup is perfect for testing agent responses without needing full Twilio setup

2. **Gradual Setup:** You can develop and test the agent logic first, then add Twilio credentials later

3. **Error Handling:** The server now provides better error messages and configuration tips

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **For Testing:** Continue using current setup - it's working perfectly for development
2. **For Production:** Add Twilio credentials to enable two-way messaging
3. **For Debugging:** Use the test endpoint to verify agent behavior

Your WhatsApp integration is actually working great! The only missing piece is the reply functionality, which just needs Twilio credentials.
